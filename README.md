# POSEIDON
POSEIDON (Photogrammetric Observation and Segmentation for Estimation of Inundation Depth ON-demand) is a scientific tool for Python-based workflow for automated flood-level extraction from imagery. It uses image segmentation and georectification to detect water surfaces and estimate flood depths over real-world terrain.
